# Private network peering plug-in for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI
{: #private_network_cli}

Use the private network peering command line interface (CLI) to configure and manage private network peering between two {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} spaces. Private network peering is supported for IBM Containers (docker containers). The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} spaces can be located in different availability zones in the same region or can be located in the different regions. The private network peering CLI plug-in is available for use with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI plug-in.

The private network peering CLI plug-in is available for Windows, MAC, and Linux operating systems. Ensure that you use the plug-in that is applicable to you.

Before you begin, create {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} spaces. Ensure that each container in a space has an IP address from a different network. For details, see [Using your own private IP address ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://www.{DomainName}/docs/containers/container_security.html#container_cli_ips_byoip){: new_window}.

**Note:** After you use the private network peering with a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} space, if you need to delete the space, first delete the private network peering connections in that space.

To get started, install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. See
[Bluemix CLI](http://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html) for details.

## Install the private network peering CLI plug-in

**Note**: If you have a previous version of the plug-in that is installed, you need to uninstall it. Use the following command to uninstall the plug-in:

```
bluemix plugin uninstall private-network-peering
```
### Install locally
Download the private network peering plug-in for your platform from [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI plug-in repository ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://plugins.ng.bluemix.net/ui/repository.html#bluemix-plugins){: new_window}.

Install the private network peering plug-in by using the following command:

**Note**: Either switch to the location of the plug-in or specify the path to the plug-in location.
