# {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI
{: #ibmcloud-admincli}

{{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} is deprecated. As of 30 November 2022 new {{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} applications cannot be created and only existing users will be able to deploy applications. End-of-support happens on 1 June 2023. Any instances that still exist on 1 June 2023 will be deleted. 
{: deprecated}

You can manage your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Local or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated environment by using the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI) with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI plug-in. For example, you can add users from an LDAP registry.

Before you begin, install the [Cloud Foundry command line interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases){: external}. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI plug-in
requires `cf` version 6.11.2 or later. Note the admin CLI can only be installed into the stand-alone Cloud Foundry CLI (`cf`), and it can't be used with the Cloud Foundry CLI that's embedded in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI (`ibmcloud cf`).

The Cloud Foundry CLI is not supported by Cygwin. Use the Cloud Foundry CLI in a command line window other than the Cygwin command line window.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI is only for use with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Local and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated environments. It is not supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public.
{: note}

Only the `cf` commands that are part of the admin CLI plug-in are described in this reference. To list all of the `cf` commands and associated help information, run the `cf help` command. To view detailed help information for a particular command, run the `cf command_name -h` command. For more information about Cloud Foundry CLI commands, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI reference guide](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/cf-help.html){: external}.

## Adding the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI plug-in
{: #add-admin-cli}

After you install the Cloud Foundry CLI, you can add the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI plug-in.

If you previously installed the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin plug-in, you might need to uninstall the plug-in, delete the repository, and then install again to get the latest updates.
{: tip}

Complete the following steps to add the repository and install the plug-in:

1. To add the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin plug-in repository, run the following command:
   ```bash
   cf add-plugin-repo IBMCloudAdmin https://<customer_console_endpoint>.bluemix.net/cli
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   You can find the same command with the actual endpoint on your admin console CLI page: `https://<customer_console_endpoint>.bluemix.net/cli`.
   {: note}

2. To install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI plug-in, run the following command:
   ```bash
   cf install-plugin IBMCloudAdminCLI -r IBMCloudAdmin
   ```
   {: codeblock}

## Uninstalling the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} admin CLI plug-in
{: #remove-admin-cli}

Complete the following steps to uninstall the plug-in. 

1. Uninstall the plug-in:
   ```bash
   cf uninstall-plugin IBMCloudAdminCLI
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Remove the plug-in repository:
   ```bash
   cf remove-plugin-repo IBMCloudAdmin
   ```
   {: codeblock}

Then, you can add the updated repository and install the latest plug-in.

## Managing users
{: #managing_users_cli}

### Adding a user
{: #admin_add_user}

To add a user to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment from the
user registry for your environment, use the following command:

```
{: codeblock}

To add a user to a specific organization, you must be an admin with the users.write (or Superuser) permission. If you're an organization manager, you can also be provided with the capability to add users to your organization by a Superuser who runs the `enable-managers-add-users` command. For more information, see [Enabling managers to add users](#clius_emau).

user_name

### Inviting a user from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}
{: #admin_dedicated_invite_public}

Each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment has a public, client-owned, corporate account in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. In order for users in the Dedicated environment to create clusters with the {{site.data.keyword.containershort}}, the administrator must add the users to this public corporate account. When the users are added to the public corporate account, their Dedicated and public accounts are linked together. Users can then use their IBMid to log in to both Dedicated and public simultaneously, and can create resources in the public account from the Dedicated interface.

To invite Dedicated users to the public account:
```bash
cf ba invite-users-to-public -userid=user_email -organization=dedicated_org_id -apikey=public_api_key -public_org_id=public_org_id
```
{: pre}

To add Dedicated environment users to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public account, you must be an Admin of the Dedicated account.

Invited users with an existing IBMid have an ACTIVE status. Invited users that didn't have an existing IBMid have a status of either PENDING or ACTIVE, depending on whether the invitation was accepted.

To list the users in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account:
```bash
cf ba invite-users-status -apikey=public_api_key
```
{: pre}

To add Dedicated environment users to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public account, you must be an admin of the Dedicated account.

## Administering application security groups
{: #admin_secgro}

To work with application security groups (ASGs), you must be a full access administrator for the local or dedicated environment. All users of the environment can list the available ASGs for the organization that is being targeted with the command. However, to create, update, or bind ASGs, you must be an administrator for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment.

ASGs function as virtual firewalls that control outbound traffic from the apps in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment. Each ASG consists of a list of rules that allow specific traffic and communication to and from the outside network. You can bind one or more ASGs to a specific security group set. For example, by applying global access for a group set or binding to spaces within an organization in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is initially set up with all access to the outside network restricted. Two IBM-created security groups, `public_networks` and `dns`, enable global access to the outside network when you bind these groups to default Cloud Foundry security group sets. The two security group sets in Cloud Foundry that are used to apply global access are the **Default Staging** and **Default Running** group sets. These group sets apply the rules for allowing traffic to all running apps or all staging apps. If you do not want to bind to these two security group sets, you can unbind from the Cloud Foundry group sets, and then bind the security group to a specific space. For more information, see [Binding Application Security Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/asg.html#binding-groups){: external}.

Unbinding the **Default Staging** or **Default Running** group sets from the two IBM-created security groups, `public_networks` and `dns` disables global access to the outside network.
