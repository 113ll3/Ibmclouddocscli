# {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}} extension for JetBrains IDEs
{: #ibm-dev-tools-for-jetbrains}

The {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_long}} extension for JetBrains IDEs, which include `IntelliJ`, `WebStorm`, `Android Studio`, and more, provides new menu entries to directly access {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI commands from within the IDE. You can quickly access a subset of `ibmcloud dev` commands for both Docker and Cloud Foundry workflows, including application deployment, starting/stopping/restarting apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, viewing remote app logs, and more. All without the need to leave the editorâ€™s context.

## Dependencies
{: #jetbrains-dependencies}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}} extension for JetBrains-based IDEs, you need the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started) installed on your system.

## Installation
{: #jetbrains-installation}

The best way to install the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} extension for JetBrains IDE, is to go to the [{{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} GitHub repo's JetBrains page](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-developer-tools/tree/master/jetbrains){: external}, and follow the instructions.

## Usage
{: #jetbrains-usage}

You can either start with an existing server-side app, and enable it for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, or use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI {{dev_cli_short}} (`ibmcloud dev`) commands to create a new app from a starter kit (`ibmcloud dev create`). When you have your app's project, open it in your JetBrains IDE.

To cloud-enable a generic server-side app, select **Tools** > **{{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}}** > **Enable app for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**. All the required files are checked, and added (if needed) for deployment to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using a Cloud Foundry app, or within a Kubernetes cluster.

Develop your cloud-native app by using the basic build, run, and deploy actions from the {{dev_cli_short}} menu. If you need to perform actions that aren't in the menu, simply open a terminal tab and enter the commands manually.
