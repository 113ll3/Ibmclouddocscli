# {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}} extension for JetBrains IDEs
{: #ibm-dev-tools-for-jetbrains}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} starter kits are deprecated. As of 18 February 2023, new applications cannot be created by using the `ibmcloud dev` commands. For current users, existing apps will continue to operate and will be supported until the End of Support date on 31 March 2023. On this date, the App commands for the "dev" plug-in will be removed to coincide with the starter kit deprecation. To see the list of specific deprecated commands, run `ibmcloud dev` from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. For more information, see the [deprecation announcement](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/deprecation-of-ibm-cloud-starter-kits){: external}.
{: deprecated}

The {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_long}} extension for JetBrains IDEs, which includes `IntelliJ`, `WebStorm`, `Android Studio`, and more, provides new menu entries to access 
{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI commands from within the IDE. You can access a subset of `ibmcloud dev` commands for Docker workflows, including commands for application deployment, and starting, stopping, and restarting apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. There are also commands for viewing remote app logs. The commands are available without leaving the editorâ€™s context.

## Dependencies
{: #jetbrains-dependencies}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}} extension for JetBrains-based IDEs, you need the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started) installed on your system.

## Installation
{: #jetbrains-installation}

The best way to install the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} extension for JetBrains IDE, is to go to the [{{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} GitHub repo's JetBrains page](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-developer-tools/tree/master/jetbrains){: external}, and follow the instructions.

## Usage
{: #jetbrains-usage}

You can either start with an existing server-side app, and enable it for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, or use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} (`ibmcloud dev`) commands to create a new app from a starter kit (`ibmcloud dev create`). When you have your app's project, open it in your JetBrains IDE.

To cloud-enable a generic server-side app, select **Tools** > **{{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}}** > **Enable app for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**. All the required files are checked, and added (if needed) for deployment within a Kubernetes cluster.

Develop your cloud-native app by using the basic build, run, and deploy actions from the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} menu. If you need to perform actions that aren't in the menu, open a terminal tab and enter the commands manually.
