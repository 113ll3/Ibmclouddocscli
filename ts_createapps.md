# Troubleshooting for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
{: #troubleshoot}

See solutions to common problems with using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Command Line Interface. In many cases, you can recover from these problems by following a few easy steps.
{: shortdesc}

## Why do I get a failure when updating the CLI, updating a plug-in, or installing a plug-in?
{: #ts-cli-version-1-failure}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

If you are attempting to update the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI, or update or install a plug-in with a CLI version lower than 2.0.0, you see an error similar to the following message.
{: tsSymptoms}

```text
An error occurred when fetching latest CLI info:
invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value
```
{: screen}

This error is caused by the older CLI version attempting to reach the deprecated CLI repo infrastructure.
{: tsCauses}

Download and install or replace the older CLI with the latest CLI version by using these [instructions](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).
{: tsResolve}

## Why does a command fail when using an API key that begins with the `-` character?
{: #ts-cli-apikey-failure}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

If you are using an API key that begins with a dash, you might encounter failures, depending on the order of the parameters in the command. For example: `ibmcloud login -r us-east --apikey -some-api-key -a https://cloud.ibm.com` produces the following error:
{: tsSymptoms}

```text
FAILED
Incorrect Usage.

NAME:
  login - Log user in

USAGE:
  ibmcloud login [-a API_ENDPOINT] [--sso] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [--apikey KEY | @KEY_FILE] [--cr-token TOKEN | @CR_TOKEN_FILE] [--profile PROFILE_ID | PROFILE_NAME] [-c (ACCOUNT_ID | ACCOUNT_OWNER_USER_ID) | --no-account] [--accept] [-g (RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME | RESOURCE_GROUP_ID)] [-r REGION | --no-region] [-o ORG] [-s SPACE] [-q, --quiet]

WARNING:
   Providing your password as a command line option is not recommended
   Your password might be visible to others and might be recorded in your shell history
   
```
{: screen}

This error is caused by the underlying flag parsing of Golang being confused by the leading `-` in the API key. 
{: tsCauses}

Reorder the commands so that the last parameter is the API key. This solution resolves the confusion and allows the command to work correctly. In the previous example, the new order is: 

```text
ibmcloud login -r us-east -a https://cloud.ibm.com --apikey -some-api-key
```
{: tsResolve}

## Why do I get a host name error when I create an application with a non-mobile pattern?
{: #ts-cli-hostname-error}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

The following error might be displayed if you use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI to deploy an application to Cloud Foundry. If you enter a unique host name, you might still see this message.
{: tsSymptoms}

```text
The hostname <myHostname> is taken.
```
{: screen}


This error is caused by an expired login token.
{: tsCauses}

Log in again by running the following command:
{: tsResolve}

```text
ibmcloud login
```
{: codeblock}


## Why do I get general command failures?
{: #ts-cli-general-failures}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

The following error might be displayed if you use the `create`, `delete`, `list`, or `code` commands:
```text
Failed to <command> app.
```
{: screen}
{: tsSymptoms}

This error is caused by an expired login token.
{: tsCauses}

Log in again by running the following command:
```text
ibmcloud login
```
{: codeblock}
{: tsResolve}

## Why is the image for a new app not recognized?
{: #ts-cli-nosuchimage}
{: troubleshoot}

When you try to `ibmcloud dev run` an app without building it first, the following error might be displayed.
```text
The run-cmd option was not specified
Stopping the 'testProject' container...
The 'testProject' container was not found
Creating image ibmcloud-dev-testProject based on Dockerfile...
OK                    
Creating a container named 'testProject' from that image...
FAILED
Container 'testProject' could not be created:
Error: No such image: ibmcloud-dev-testProject
```
{: screen}
{: tsSymptoms}

You must build an app before you run it. Run the following command in your current app directory:
```text
ibmcloud dev build
```
{: codeblock}
{: tsCauses}

Run the following command in your current app directory to start your app:
```text
ibmcloud dev run
```
{: tsResolve}

## Why do I get a service broker error when I add the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} capability?
{: #ts-cli-object-storage}
{: troubleshoot}

The following error might be displayed if you use the CLI to create two apps with the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} capability:

```text
FAILED
Service broker error: {"description"=>"You can not create this Object Storage instance. Each organization using the Object Storage service is limited to one instance of the Free plan."}
```
{: screen}
{: tsSymptoms}

This error is due to the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} service, which provides only one instance of the free {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} plan.
{: tsCauses}

Select a different plan.
{: tsResolve}

## Why isn't code retrieved when I create an app?
{: #retrieve-code-error}
{: troubleshoot}

The following error might be displayed when you use the CLI to create an app:
```text
FAILED                            
App created, but could not get code
https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/projects/b22165f3-cbc6-4f73-876f-e33cbec199d4/code
```
{: screen}
{: tsSymptoms}

This error is due to an internal timeout.
{: tsCauses}

Use one of the following ways to get the code:

* Run the following command:

   ```text
   ibmcloud dev code <your-app-name>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Replace `<your-app-name>` with the app name that you specified during app creation.

* Use the {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}.

	1. Select your [app](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources){: external} in the {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}.

	2. Click **Download Code**.
{: tsResolve}

    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:579:10)
```
{: screen}
{: tsSymptoms}

This error occurs when the `appmetrics` module is installed on a different architecture. Native `npm` modules that are installed on one architecture do not work on another. The included Docker images are based on the Linux&trade; kernel.
{: tsCauses}

Delete the `node_modules` folder and run the `ibmcloud dev run` command again.
{: tsResolve}

## Why can't I deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}?
{: #ts-cli-deploy-issues}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

A failure occurs when you try to deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, but no error is displayed.
{: tsSymptoms}

```text
FAILED
Failed to execute the action:  exit status 1:

FAILED
Failed to configure deployment with cluster '<cluster-name>' due to: exit status 1
```
{: screen}
{: tsSymptoms}

The problem is most likely due to a cluster name that's not valid. You can confirm the cause by running the same command with `--trace`, and the following details might be included in the error output:
```text
Failing with error:  {"incidentID":"<id-number>","code":"E0008","description":"The specified cluster could not be found.","recoveryCLI":"Run 'ibmcloud cs clusters' to list all clusters you have access to.","type":"Provisioning"}
```

{: tsResolve}

## Why can't I build the Docker image?
{: #ts-cli-docker}
{: troubleshoot}

If you see the following the error: 
```text
FAILED
An error exit status 1 was encountered while building the Docker 
image.
```
{: screen}
