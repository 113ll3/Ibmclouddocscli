# {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Command Line Interface (ibmcloud cli) Plug-ins
{: #cli_plugins}

Extend your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command line interface (ibmcloud cli) with Plug-ins. You can install and use Plug-ins that are available in the [CLI Plug-in Repository ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://plugins.ng.bluemix.net/){: new_window}. Each plug-in is identified by its binary file name, its developer-defined plug-in name, and the commands that the plug-in provides. You can use the binary file name only to install a plug-in, and use the plug-in name or a command for any other action.
