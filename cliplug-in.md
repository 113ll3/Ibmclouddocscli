# Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface Plug-ins
{: #cf_cli_plugins}

You can install and use Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf cli) Plug-ins that are available on [CLI Plug-in Repository ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://plugins.ng.bluemix.net/){: new_window}. Each plug-in is identified by its binary file name, its developer-defined plug-in name, and the commands that the plug-in provides. You can use the binary file name only to install a plug-in, and use the plug-in name or a command for any other action.
